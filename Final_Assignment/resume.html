            Overall, my experience in the course was amazing. The lectures were very
            informative, and Professor Navreet Lehal did a
            great job explaining the different concepts. Although the lectures were more asynchronus but I was able to
            grasp the learning material quickly because the
            lectures were taught in a way that
            , I even being beginner with no prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was to able learn the concepts easily. The assignments also just
            further enhanced the amount of material. Intially, I had difficulty in doing assignments as I had no
            previous knowledge about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS but as professor taught week by week, my knowledge grew
            and I found fun doing the stuff.
            Also, with the time I was able to analyze what the piece of code I wrote was doing, and wherever it creates error, I was able find and tried solving the error,
            but if I wsan't able to correct it, I watch the lecture recording again and then solve it.<br>
            <span class="tab"></span>A few concepts that I learned in this course include, creating a website that can
            alert and prompt a user for values,
            website design such as the layout and responsiveness, also how to create a form that can ask the user to
            input values and submit it. Another
            concept that I learned in the course was something called ElectronApp. This was a very new concept that I
            never knew before and was interesting
            to use and see in practice.<br>
            <span class="tab"></span>These concepts learned in WEB222 will help me in better understanding the next
            course WEB322 and in the future, if I
            decide to go into web development for my career.
